LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/eHDSIMedicalImagingReportType,ValueSet/eHDSILabCode,ValueSet/eHDSISection,ValueSet/eHDSIBloodPressure,ValueSet/eHDSIMedicalImagesType,ValueSet/eHDSILabStudyType,ValueSet/eHDSIDocumentCode,ValueSet/eHDSILaboratoryReportType,ValueSet/eHDSIPregnancyInformation"

The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role. Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.    The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:     *  **RoleClassOntological** is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.   *  **RoleClassPartitive** collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a ""part"" of the scoping entity.   *  **RoleClassAssociative** collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:             *  **RoleClassPassive** which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.       *  **RoleClassMutualRelationship** which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be *de facto* behavior. Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:                     *  **RoleClassRelationshipFormal** in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.           *  **Personal relationship** which inks two people in a personal relationship.    The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the ""Personal relationship"" which is a leaf concept.    *OpenIssue:* Description copied from Concept Domain of same name.
